 TetWiis - A Nintendo WII Tetris Clone, shamelessly based on the Nintendo DS
 version of Tetris.  

 TetWiis is freeware, can be distributed freely and should never be charged for.

 This has taken a considerable amount of time to create.  If you would like to
 give something back, you'll find a donate link on my website.  If not don't
 worry and enjoy the game!

 Wiimote Controls
 ===================================

 Use the wiimote pointer in the menus to select the options and start the game.
 Point at the menu items with the wiimote and press A to select the options.

 The options screen allows you to turn up/down the volume of the background
 music and the sound effects.


 Once the game starts you'll need to use your wiimote in the horizontal position, 
 e.g.


  +---------------------------------------+
 #|   ---                                 |
 #|  -|U|-   ---     [+]                  | 
 #| |L   R|  |A|     [H]       [1]  [2]   | 
 #|  -|D|-   ---     [-]                  |          
 #|   ---                                 |
  +---------------------------------------+

 The game will count down from 3 flashing an image of a horizontal wiimote 
 as a reminder and will start after the count.  This gives you time to rotate
 the wiimote before the blocks start dropping!

 Controls during the game are as follows
 
 left      - move block left one square
 right     - move block right one square
 down      - move block down quickly
 up        - Immediately Drop the block into place
 1         - Rotate the block anticlockwsise
 2         - Rotate the block clockwise
 A         - Hold a piece/swap the piece for the one already held
 Home      - Pause the game

 Every ten lines you clear increases the level, which increase the speed at 
 which the blocks drop.

 Home      - Exit
 Start/+   - Start Game
 Select/-  - Options
 a/b       - Adjust Music Volume in Options
 x/y       - Adjust SFX volume in options
 
 In game controls
 left      - move block left one square
 right     - move block right one square
 down      - move block down quickly
 up        - Immediately Drop the block into place
 a         - Rotate the block clockwise
 b         - Rotate the block anticlockwise
 R         - Hold a piece/swap the piece for the one already held
 Home      - Pause the game


 Scoring
 ===================================

 More score can be achieved for getting double/triple/quad lines and
 back to back quad lines.  The higher the level, the higher the rewarded
 score, but the faster the blocks start to drop!


 Change Log
 ===================================

 12th September 2010 v1.1
  - Implemented clockwise/anticlockwise rotation of the blocks.  Button (1) on
    the wiimote and (b) on the classic controller now rotate anticlockwise.
  - Adjusted the key repeat timings for improved control
  - Fixed the DOWN press release timer to give you a small amount of time 
    before the key repeat kicks in again.
  - Implemented a pause menu (Pressing Home Button Ingame) where you can 
    return to the game menu, or exit to the loader
  - Added a graphical reminder on the high score entry screen that the wiimote
    should be vertical
  - Resolved a few minor bugs.

 26th August 2010 v1.0
  - Enlarged Game field
  - High Score Table
  - Warning sound when you near the top of the gamefield
  - Implented key repeat so you can hold down the DPAD rather than 
    continuously pressing
  - Sound options now saved
  - IOS58/USB Support through HBC 1.08
  - In game Sound looping improved
  - Classic Controller Support
  - Various bug fixes

 18th November 2009 v0.1b
  - Initial beta release to get feedback and testing results

 Known Issues / Missing Features
 ===================================

  - Rotate of blocks not quite like the DS version of Tetris
  - Unlike the DS version, you can't keep rotating the block to prevent
    it from dropping when at the bottom.
