TetWiis - A Nintendo WII Tetris Clone, shamelessly based on the Nintendo DS version of Tetris.

Every ten lines you clear increases the level, which increases the speed at which the blocks drop.
You'll score more points by clearing 2,3 or 4 lines at a time, or even going for the dangerous back2back clearance of 4 lines (clearing 8 in successive drops!)

-----------------------------
Use the pointer and 'A' in the menu screens to change the options and start/exit the game.
